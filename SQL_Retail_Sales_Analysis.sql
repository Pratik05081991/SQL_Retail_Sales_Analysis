---DATA EXPLORATION

---How many sales do we have?

SELECT COUNT(*) as total_sale FROM retail_sales;

---How many unique customers do we have?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as total_sale FROM retail_sales;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) as total_sale FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category as total_sale FROM retail_sales;

---Data Analysis & Business Key Problems & Answers

ORDER BY customer_id ASC;

--3. Write a SQL Query to calculate the total_sales (Total_sale) for each category.

FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1;

	RANK() OVER(PARTITION By EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1,2
--ORDER BY 1,3 DESC;
) as t1
WHERE rank = 1
